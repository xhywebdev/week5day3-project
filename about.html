            <h2>Why Adoption?</h2>
            <p>There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. Adopting from a shelter helps
                weaken the pet overpopulation cycle. Each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are
                euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them. </p>

                    <p>Staff will email you a Pre-Adoption Survey. This survey helps our staff learn more about you and
                        your household, so we can help you find a good fit for your family.</p>

                    <p>If a potential match is made during the adoption counseling call, an in-person appointment will
                        be set up to meet with the animal(s) and complete the adoption. </p>
